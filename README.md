# Pokedex
In this project I wanted to create a pokedex website, where you could know the abilities of pokemons by searching them by name.

## Usage
This project was made for users who want to know more information about pokemons; such as their name, ID number, image, stats, type, height, abilities, and their moves.

All of the information listed is going to be displayed on the screen using a pokedex-like design.

With the arrow keys of the pokedex' interface you can browse into the list of other pokemons, navigating through the ID number.

## Mobile version
Because of the popularity of smartphones nowadays, you can use de pokedex website in your phone, displaying the same information as in the desktop version.
